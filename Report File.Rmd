#what is our business problem?
proposals:
1. Predicting Video Trendiness: Identify factors that contribute to a video's likelihood of trending on YouTube. Businesses and content creators could use this to optimize their video content and publishing strategies.

2. Understanding Regional Content Preferences: Analyze differences in trending videos across different countries. This could help businesses tailor their content to specific regions and expand their global reach.

3. Optimizing Video Engagement: Determine which video characteristics (e.g., title length, tags, description sentiment) correlate with higher engagement metrics (e.g., views, likes, comments). Businesses could use this to improve audience engagement and retention.

4. Competitive Analysis: Analyze trending videos within a specific niche or industry to understand what types of content are performing well and identify potential opportunities for differentiation.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Define the dataset name
#dataset_name <- "asaniczka/trending-youtube-videos-113-countries"

# Define the destination path (optional)
#destination_path <- "C:/Users/LRJPu/OneDrive - Delft University of Technology/Documenten/TU delft/MOT/Y1-Q3/BA/Assignment/BA_Group12"

# Run the Kaggle API command
#system(paste("kaggle datasets download -d", dataset_name, "-p", destination_path, "--unzip"))

# Confirm download
#print(paste("Dataset downloaded to:", destination_path))

#list.files(destination_path, pattern = "\\.zip$")
#unzip(paste0(destination_path, "/"), exdir = destination_path)

#if we use Kaggle API lets update this part!

destination_path = "C:/Users/LRJPu/OneDrive - Delft University of Technology/Documenten/TU delft/MOT/Y1-Q3/BA/Assignment/BA_Group12/trending_yt_videos_113_countries.csv"

df <- read.csv(destination_path)

```
Now we have loaded and downloaded the most recent dataset from Kaggle.

Let's do an Exploratory Data Analysis!

```{r}
install.packages("dplyr")


```

```{r}
#view the first rows
#head(df)
#some math numbers/insights
#var(df$daily_rank)
#summary(df)
#str(df)
dim(df)
#is.na(df)
#no empty values found
#count(df["NA"])

#group the dataset per country
library(dplyr)
grouped_df <- df%>% group_by(country)
country_counts <- grouped_df%>% summarise(count = n())
print(mean(country_counts$count))

#ungrouping
df_ungrouped <- grouped_df %>% ungroup()

```
#Insights
- dimensioning before grouping is 2743099 Rows, 18 Columns
- ''language'' column seems to have empty values+different type of values e.g.: "zh-TW", or "ja",or "en-US"
- 'video-tags'column has alot of empty values
- 'description'column has alot of empty values
- from grouping it follows that we have 113 Countries with an average of 24275.21 instances
- the ranking seems to be per country? so we have multiple top 5 etc

#Questions n.a.v. EDA
1. why is df$daily_rank different ranking? multiple top 1, 2, 3 etc 
--> each country has their unique ranking, so we should combine df[daily_rank] with df[country] to make assumptions per country

2. What is our output variable?
--> could be daily_rank, view_count, or weekly_movement/daily_movement (if focus on rapidly getting trendy)

3.Should we normalize our data? all or some columns? 



```{r cars}

```
```{r}
#Principal Component Analysis
df$daily_rank
df$view_count
df <-prcomp(df[,c("daily_rank","view_count")])
cbind(head(df$daily_rank),head(df))
```
##webscraping
Lets add webscraping to get the exact comments!
```{r}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
